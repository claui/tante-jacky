This repository contains source code vendored from different parties.
Therefore, multiple sets of license terms apply to different parts of this repository.

The following table shows which terms apply to which directory trees:

| `web-extension/.yarn/releases` | BSD-2-Clause | [LICENSE](./.yarn/releases/LICENSE) |
| `web-extension/vendor/addons-linter-5.0.0` | MPL-2.0 | [LICENSE](./vendor/addons-linter-5.0.0/LICENSE) |
| `web-extension` (this program) | GPL-3.0-or-later | [LICENSE](./LICENSE)<br>with License header below |

You will find a dedicated `LICENSE` file in each of those directories.

Each `LICENSE` file applies to the whole directory subtree of the directory where the `LICENSE` file itself is located, but not to any subdirectory which contains a `LICENSE` file on its own.
