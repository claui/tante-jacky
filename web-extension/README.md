## Handling vulnerable transitive dependencies

tante-jacky has zero runtime dependencies.

It does has development-time dependencies, though. People are
frequently discovering vulnerabilities in those packages.
Therefore, I have to apply patches in order to protect both my own
development environment and the build machine that you are using to
package the extension.

I have force-upgraded a vulnerable transitive dependency using a
shell command:

### Vulnerability in update-notifier, dependency of web-ext v7.1.0

Manually bump `web-ext`â€™s dependency `update-notifier` to v6.0.2
in order to bump the transitive dependency `got` to v11.8.5:

```shell
yarn set resolution --save update-notifier@npm:5.1.0 6.0.2
```

(Remove this section once an upgrade to `web-ext` is available
that depends on update-notifier v6.0.2 or higher.)
